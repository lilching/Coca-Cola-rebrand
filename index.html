                            This report is a reflection of how, together with our bottling partners, we navigated the COVID-19 crisis as a global business while advancing our environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities.
                            Having passed several of our 2020 milestone ESG goals, we are working toward new plans, including our 2025 packaging goals, 2030 climate goal, new 2030 water strategy and streamlining our global beverage portfolio – all of which are detailed in the report.

                        While many view our company as simply "Coca-Cola," our system operates through multiple local channels.
                The primary way that our products reach the marketplace starts with Coca-Cola, which manufactures and sells concentrates, beverage bases and syrups to bottling operations.
                Coca-Cola also owns the brands and is responsible for consumer brand marketing initiatives.
                Our bottling partners manufacture, package, merchandise and distribute final branded beverages to our customers and vending partners, who then sell our products to consumers.
                All bottling partners work closely with customers –grocery stores, restaurants, street vendors, convenience stores, movie theaters and amusement parks, among many others –to execute localized strategies developed in partnership with our company.
                Customers then sell our products to consumers at a rate of 1.9 billion servings a day.
